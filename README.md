# MNIST-digit-classification
This code can classify 10 handwritten digit by simple neural network using Pytorch

# Problem Type
Classification, 
Number of Class: 10,
Task: handwritten digit classification

# Framework
Pytorch. I am using pytorch here as most of the recent researchers and scientist are using this famework insted of TensorFlow. Also I have heard Pytorch is comparetively easy to learn for begineer like me.
