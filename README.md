# MNIST-digit-classification
This code can classify 10 handwritten digit by simple neural network using Pytorch

# Problem Type
Classification, 
Number of Class = 10,
Task: handwritten digit classification

# Dataset
Name: MNIST, 
Source: torchvision.dataset.MNIST in Pytorch, 
Image Size = 28 * 28, 
Total samples = 70,000 (60,000 for training, 10,000 for testing)

# Framework
Pytorch. I am using pytorch here as most of the recent researchers and scientists are using this famework insted of TensorFlow. Also I have heard Pytorch is comparetively easy to learn for begineer like me.



# Neural Network Hyperparameters
Epoch = 2, 
Learning rate = 0.001,
Batch size = 100
